# Final Greenfoot Project
This is the README.md file.

The goal of my game is to defeat all the orcs (enemies) and reach the door at the top of the castle. Someone can get started playing my game by clicking the start button. Left click to shoot fireballs, press 'a' and 'd' to move left and right, press the 'e' key to interact with ladders and the final door (only when all orcs are defeated).
