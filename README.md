# Final Greenfoot Project
This is the README.md file.

The goal of my game is to defeat all the orcs (enemies) and reach the door at the top of the castle. Someone can get started playing my game by clicking the start button. If they don't know how to play, they can click the Instructions button to read which keys do what, then exit back into the title screen.
